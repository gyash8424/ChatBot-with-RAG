## Project Description
The developed chatbot delivers highly accurate responses tailored to the specific context provided. By using custom embeddings and optimized data, it improves metrics such as accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction. The chatbot is able to process extensive information in forms of articles, research papers, multiple books, and save them in its long-term memory using a vector database.

## Motivation
While chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini are trained on massive amounts of data and are excellent for general use, they often fall short when it comes to 𝐝𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧-𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞.
This project aims to create such a QnA chatbot which can be used by diffrent users accross diffrent sectors easily by providing any specific data, with advance data security by not sharing their data with anyone else.
